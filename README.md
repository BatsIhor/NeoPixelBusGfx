NeoPixelBusGfx
===============

Note: I am using the same version numbers like NeoMatrix but with an additional number. -> Only the tags with 4 numbers are NeoPixelBusGfx and compatible with NeoPixelBus

Adafruit_GFX-compatible library for NeoPixelBus library. It supports everything which is supported by NeoPixelBus. Requires NeoPixelBus and Adafruit_GFX libraries.

* Note that not all examples are converted currently.

After downloading, rename folder to 'NeoPixelBusGfx' and install in Arduino Libraries folder. Restart Arduino IDE, then open File->Sketchbook->Library->NeoPixelBusGfx->matrixtest sketch.
